The file in this directory, named "CDMDataDictionary.html", contains a complete CDM Data Dictionary that documents the CDM - BRUDG Cross Mappings for multiple Common Data Models including i2b2/ACT, PCORNET, OMOP, and Sentinel, as well as FHIR (Partial).

The team developed a maintenance and curation plan and implemented a version control for software and data dissemination. The developed CDM mappings will require maintenance throughout the lifecycle of the project.
